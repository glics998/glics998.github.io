  It took a long time for me to see it. 
  For me to see the ocean. 
  For me to see the stars. For me to see the flowers. 
  It took a long time. 
  Felt like centuries almost. 
  It took a long time for me to see me. 
  Look at yourself. 
  Pick out every beautiful, intricate detail: 
  the brown long hair with streaks of blonde 
  somewhere in between, with waves, 
  waves that look like the water that 
  rides up onto the beach during high tide.
