    <div class="text2">remeber when we went on your boat a few years ago. and we were hungry so we went to subway for lunch. and i somehow lost both of my flip flops in the car. and you were so hungry that you made me walk into subway and order my food with my bare hooves out. and than you almost peed from laughter when the lady infront of us ordering her sandwich started dancing and than gave us a dirty look.
