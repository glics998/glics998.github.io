    <div class="text2">We were in Eisenhower Park. As usual you were always looking for someone to play with. Sometimes I would find you children to play with, but this park doesnâ€™t many children. You spotted a group of boys and immediately ran to them calling out friends YOU told me you were going to give them money so they would play with you. I advice you not to because you can't buy friends,you ran over to them with hands filled with coins.I don't know what you said to them, but I saw them take your money. You were on the swings for five minutes,your friends jumped off swings and ran away,The look on your face was priceless "how could they do this.</div>
