  <p>I would say I’m <span class="word-adjective-1"></span> and <span class="word-adjective-2"></span>. 
    I like to use <span class="art-supply"></span> to decorate my apartment. 
    I would say I'm a pretty tech savy but,
    I do hate using <span class="computer-software"></span>. 
    On the other hand I love to use <span class="website-name"></span> in my free time.
    If you don’t know <span class="artist-name"></span> 
    or <span class="celebrity-name"></span> then I definitely can’t date you so keep looking.
    I’m love with <span class="noun-1"></span> 
    but hate <span class="noun-2"></span>. 
    I also enjoy on adventurous dates that involve <span class="plural-noun-1"></span>
    , <span class="plural-noun-2"></span>
     and <span class="plural-noun-3"></span>.  
     If I’m not working you can find me <span class="verb-ending-in-ing"></span>
      in <span class="place-in-new-york"></span>.
    One of my many talents is being able to wiggle my <span class="body-part"></span>. 
    My favorite numbers are <span class="numbers"></span>
    and I love to eat <span class="foods"></span> .
    If you’ve made it this far you might as well ask me out. ;)</p>
