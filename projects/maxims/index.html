  <div class="neon3">FUTURE ME </div>

  <div class="neon1">Everything I’m not made me everything I am.</div>

  <div class="neon">Just remember when you think all is lost, the future remains.

 <div class="neon1">Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it.</div>

 <div class="neon">Believe you can then you will.

 <div class="neon1">The best way to predict the future is to create it.</div>

  <div class="neon">And this is the part where you find out who you are. 

 <div class="neon1">Don’t forget we’ve got unfinished business and stories yet to unfold.</div>

 <div class="neon">Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. 

    <div class="neon1">Life is so unpredictable. Be grateful for every moment.</div>

    <div class="neon">If you really want something you don’t stop for anyone until you get it.

   <div class="neon1">You can achieve everything you put your mind to.</div>

   <div class="neon">Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.

   <div class="neon1">I don’t know where I’m going from here but I promise it won’t be boring.</div>

    <div class="neon">The only person you are destined to become, is the person you desire to be.

   <div class="neon1">The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams.</div>
